# Psych-Coding
Assignment 3 

I've recently started watching a new show, Steinfeld. Steinfeld was popular in the 1980s and although I have heard of it, I hadn't started it until now. My old AP psych teacher in high school loved the show and applied it to a lot of our lessons. He would even show some clips of it in class to display some of the new concepts we were learning. My friend started watching it and showed me an episode and I started up myself. I use to be a big fan of the show friends, I would say Steinfeld has a similar style but uses more humor. My favorite character in the show is Kramer. Kramer is the hilarious neighbor that makes nonsensical decisions and doesn't work like the other characters. Instead he somehow has enough money to live in a New York apartment with no stable job. He usually is found taking and eating food in Jerry Seinfeld's apartment and making funny commentary. He somehow is able to get all the girls that George and Jerry want as well, he is taken as quite the charmer regardless of his clumsiness.
